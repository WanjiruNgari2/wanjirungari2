#  Hello, I'm Damah!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I’m a **fullstack developer** with a growing passion for **scripting, automation, and problem-solving through code**. I’m currently focused on learning how to make computers handle repetitive tasks — whether that’s cleaning data, moving files, or automating web actions — using JavaScript and Node.js.

I shall however transfer this to python and beautifulSoup afterwards.

##  About Me

-  I’ve completed the **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Foundations** course, where I gained a strong grasp of cloud basics and automation concepts.  
- I’m now teaching myself **scripting and automation** through hands-on coding — following YouTube tutorials, experimenting with small projects, and breaking (then fixing) things to learn deeply.  
-  My current focus: mastering **Node.js scripting**, **browser automation** (Puppeteer / Playwright), and **API-based tasks**.  
-  My learning philosophy: *"Don’t rush. Understand the why, then the how."*

## Current Learning Path

I’m building my scripting skills step-by-step:
1. **File system automation** — reading, renaming, and organizing files using Node.js.  
2. **Web automation** — simulating user actions on websites using Puppeteer.  
3. **API integration** — fetching and sending data to automate online workflows.  
4. **Cloud basics** — continuing to explore automation within OCI environments.  

As I go, I’m creating a collection of simple but useful scripts — each one teaching me something new about efficiency, logic, and creativity.

## Collaboration & Goals

I’m actively looking to **collaborate** with other learners or developers who:  
- Need help with automation or scripting tasks  
- Want to pair-program or share feedback  
- Enjoy experimenting and learning in public  

I believe collaboration is the fastest way to grow — and it’s *a lot more fun* when you share the process!  
If you have a project where I can contribute or learn alongside you, please reach out. I’m eager to help, explore, and improve.

## Motto

> *"Code to understand, automate to simplify, and collaborate to grow."*  
> Every small script I write teaches me something new — and that’s what keeps me going.
